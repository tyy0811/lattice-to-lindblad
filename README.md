# lattice-to-lindblad
A validation-focused collection of code and results spanning lattice gauge theory and open quantum systems. Includes Schwinger-model Hamiltonian checks, VQE/ED static benchmarks, real-time field quenches (string breaking), and Lindblad quarkonium-in-medium studies with continuum analyses.
